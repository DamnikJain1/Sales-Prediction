# Sales_Prediction
The dataset is taken from kaggle (Reference: https://www.kaggle.com/sazid28/advertising.csv)<br/>
I have implemented Linear Regression to predict the sales of a company based upon the expenses made over advertisement sources, such as TV, Newspaper, Radio. <br/>
The main aim is to analyse which advertisement source provides more profit for the sales.<br/>

Advertising.csv contains the dataset. <br/>
Sales_Prediction.ipynb is the jupyter notebook containing the implementation. <br/>
